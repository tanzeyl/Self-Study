      Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not
      simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
      from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
      professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
      obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going
      through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
      undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of
      "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
      written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
      popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem
      ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The
      standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for
      those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et
      Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
      accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
      Where can I get some? There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum
      available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by
      injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly
      believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to
      be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.
      All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined
      chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.
      It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of
      model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
      The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,
      injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc. 5 paragraphs words bytes
